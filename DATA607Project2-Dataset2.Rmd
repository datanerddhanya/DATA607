Dataset 2:Weather Data (by Institution): Average Temperature, Days of Precipitation, and Sunny Days

Analysis: 
To acquire the data, tidy, clean, transform and visualize the data

Conclusion:
1.I observed that few  of the institute like Ramapo College of New Jersey does not have a Avg temperature for few months.Hence had to use na.rm=true to remove them.
2.when visualized the avg mean temperature, through histogram its is multimodal distribution and is not symmetric.
3. i see a negative correlation between the two.lesser the precipitation, more are the sunny days.
