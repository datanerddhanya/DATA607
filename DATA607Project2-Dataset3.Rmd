Dataset 3: 
New York City Air Quality Data

Analysis:
Compare air pollutants levels vs. locations vs. time of year.

Conclusion:

I can observe here that the pollution levels for Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Fine particles (PM 2.5) have decreased over the years.

Midtown(CD5) location has the highest pollution levels for Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Fine particles (PM 2.5) for 2021.
